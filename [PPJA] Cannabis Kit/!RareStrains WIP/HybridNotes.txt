// Things To Note Notes
- I have done my best to portray these strains as closely to their real world counterparts as possible. However many strains look similar so some may be indentical/near identical. 
- Hybridization is a complex process. Many strains are made from hybrids. I have picked some strains to use for this process and would like to expand upon it further but for now you can only create 10 strains from inputting two strains into a seedmaker. This is documented here.
- I don't know much about weed. If something is wrong feel free to send a PR with a correction or suggestions on what to add.
- Indica, Sativa, and Hybrid were crops in ___'s mod rather than classifications. Since this mod has been expanded to include 26 new strains these assets have been recycled into other strains and Indica, Sativa, and Hybrid removed. Some descriptions include what type they are but this has no effect on what you can/cannot do with them. If you have ideas feel free to suggest them on Github.
- Shatter has been moved to the grinder. This is to hopefully put another bandaid on until changes are made to PFM to allow context_tags in FuelIdentifier. If there is a better machine feel free to suggest.
